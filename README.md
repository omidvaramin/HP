# Headline Popularity (HP) Dataset
We use the tweets ID from Clickbait challenge 2017 (https://zenodo.org/record/5530410) dataset to crawl the information regarding the tweets from Twitter. 
The post_text and target_paragraphs fields were derived from the clickbait challenge dataset but the rest of the fields were obtained from Twitter.
